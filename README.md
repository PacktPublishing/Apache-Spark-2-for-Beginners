#Apache Spark 2 for Beginners
This is the code repository for [Apache Spark 2 for Beginners](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/apache-spark-2-beginners?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885006), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

##Code Bundle

| Chapter number | Software required (with version) | Free/Proprietary | If proprietary, can code testing be performed using a trial version | If proprietary, then cost of the software | Download links to the software | Hardware specifications | OS required |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| All | Apache Spark 2.0.0 | Free | NA | NA | http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html | X86 | UNIX or MacOSX |

## Detailed installation steps (software-wise)
The steps should be listed in a way that it prepares the system environment to be able to test the codes of the book.
###1. Apache Spark:
a. Download Spark version mentioned in the table<br>
b. Build Spark from source or use the binary download and follow the detailed instructions given in the page http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html<br>
c. If building Spark from source, make sure that the R profile is also built and the instructions to do that is given in the link given inthe step b.<br>
###2. Apache Kafka
a. Download Kafka version mentioned in the table<br>
b. The “quick start” section of the Kafka documentation gives the instructions to setup Kafka.
http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart<br>
c. Apart from the installation instructions, the topic creation and the other Kafka setup pre-requisites have been covered in detail in the chapter of the book<br>


The code will look like the following:
```
Python 3.5.0 (v3.5.0:374f501f4567, Sep 12 2015, 11:00:19)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
```

Spark 2.0.0 or above is to be installed on at least a standalone machine to run the code samples and do further activities to learn more about the subject. For Spark Stream Processing, Kafka needs to be installed and configured as a message broker with its command line producer producing messages and the application developed using Spark as a consumer of those messages.
